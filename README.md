## **📝 How to Play?**  
1. Run the Python script.  
2. Choose one of the following options:  
   - 🐍 **Snake** → Press `s`  
   - 💧 **Water** → Press `w`  
   - 🔫 **Gun** → Press `g`  
3. The computer also makes a random choice.  
4. The game determines the winner based on the classic **Snake-Water-Gun** rules:  
   - 🐍 Snake **drinks** Water → **Snake wins**  
   - 💧 Water **douses** Gun → **Water wins**
